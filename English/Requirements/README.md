## Programming

If you want to learn machine learning, programming literacy is must. You have some choice to learn but I recommend you to learn Python first.

### Python

Python is the most popular language to program machine learning. It is easy to learn and readable. Python community is enthusiastically develop libraries of numerical calculation and machine learning. Python has powerful tool to learn or research named Jupyter.

If you've never learned Python nor programming, try these.
* ["Dive into Python 3"](http://www.diveintopython3.net/): It is useful textbook of Python3 but out-of-dated. There are
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)

I __attention__ you before __you install Python__. If you want to install python on your computer, there is a lot of choice. However, Installing from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) directly is not a good choice. I recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which is management tool of python environment. Try Jupyter notebook on Anaconda. Anaconda and Jupyter is not required knowledge of shell(terminal).

## Math

To learn machine learning, you must know about math.

* Linear Algebra
* Calculus
* Statics
* Probability
* Bayesian
