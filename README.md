## Machine Learning

There are two approach to learn machine learning.

* You primarily learn theory of machine learning. After you understand basic machine learning theory, you build something.
* You don't effort to understand and build something you need many times. After that, you try to understand the theory of machine learning

In this guide, you learn the basic theory before you build something useful. But you don't have to understand the theory perfectly. If you understand roughly, it's time to build something.

### Online Courses

There are some well-known online courses learning Machine Learning.

* [Coursera: Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning): This is basic machine learning course. It may be the most popular learning resource. This is perfect except using Octave.
* [Udacity: Intro to machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
* [Machine Learning Tutorials and Courses(hackr.io)](https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-machine-learning-ml): other links of learning materials.

Online courses are useful free online resources. Recently, trying online courses is the best way to learn something.

I found a lot of online courses, when I search in Google. But you may learn "Coursera Stanford Machine learning" first.

### Beginners' e-books

Coming soon ...

### Required knowledge

The below is the list of Required knowledge. The most of online courses and e-books set required knowledge. If you want to learn about required knowledge or you don't meet requirements, please read [requirements page](./English/requirements.md).

* Programming
  * Python (/R/C++/Matlab ...)
* Math
  * Linear Algebra
  * Calculus
  * Statics
  * Probability
  * Bayesian
* Computer Science
  * Algorithm
  * Data Structure

### Environmental settings

I recommend you to use python and python-libraries, so I introduce you to install those in the [environment page](./English/environment.md).

I also recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and Jupyter. I wrote [an example of using Jupyter notebook](./English/python3/example_of_jupyter_notebook.ipynb). Jupyter is powerful tool to learn or research.

## Advanced Guide

If you learn the basic of machine learning, you have several choices.

* build your applications with using [libraries and tools](#libraries-and-tools)
* build something on [clouds](#clouds)
* build your simple machine learning software from scratch
* participate some [competitions](#competition) and prove your machine learning skill
