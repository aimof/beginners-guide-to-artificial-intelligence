## Machine Learning

There are two approach to learn machine learning.

* You primarily learn theory of machine learning. After you understand basic machine learning theory, you build something.
* You don't effort to understand and build something you need many times. After that, you try to understand the theory of machine learning

In this guide, you learn the basic theory before you build something useful. But you don't have to understand the theory perfectly. If you understand roughly, it's time to build something.

### Online Courses

There are some well-known online courses learning Machine Learning.

* [Coursera: Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning): This is basic machine learning course. It may be the most popular learning resource. This is perfect except using Octave.
* [Udacity: Intro to machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
* [Machine Learning Tutorials and Courses(hackr.io)](https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-machine-learning-ml): other links of learning materials.

Online courses are useful free online resources. Recently, trying online courses is the best way to learn something.

I found a lot of online courses, when I search in Google. But you may learn "Coursera Stanford Machine learning" first.

### Beginners' e-books

Coming soon ...

### Required knowledge

The below is the list of Required knowledge. The most of online courses and e-books set required knowledge. If you want to learn about required knowledge or you don't meet requirements, please read [requirements page](./English/requirements/README.md).

* Programming
  * Python (/R/C++/Matlab ...)
* Math
  * Linear Algebra
  * Calculus
  * Statics
  * Probability
  * Bayesian
* Computer Science
  * Algorithm
  * Data Structure

### Environmental settings

I recommend you to use python and python-libraries, so I introduce you to install those in the [environment page](./English/environment/README.md).

I also recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and Jupyter. I wrote [an example of using Jupyter notebook](./English/python3_jupyter/example_of_jupyter_notebook.ipynb). Jupyter is powerful tool to learn or research.

## Advanced Guide

If you learn the basic of machine learning, you have several choices.

* build your applications with using [libraries and tools](#libraries-and-tools)
* build something on [clouds](#clouds)
* build your simple machine learning software from scratch
* participate some [competitions](#competition) and prove your machine learning skill

### What is your purpose or difficulty

If you want to more understand the theory or you feel your understanding is not so perfect, [building your simple machine learning software from scratch](#program-machine-learning-from-scratch) is helpful to your understanding. It is a good way to understand something that program this.

If you want to program something with some libraries, I recommend to try [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)([github](https://github.com/openai/gym)). 

### the Libraries and tools

I recommend you some machine learning libraries, next step. If you cannot use Jupyter notebook, you are needed to set up. Please read [the environment section on this page](#environmental-settings) or [the environmental setting page](./English/environment)

* [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)([github](https://github.com/openai/gym)): This is a reinforcement learning library. An example of program made through Open AI Gym is Game AI. If you interested in old games like Atari, it is a great choice to play Open AI Gym.
*

Or you want to use other libraries or tools, please read [The Guide of Libraries and tools](./Engilish/Libraries/README.md).

### Clouds

coming soon ...

## Program machine learning from scratch

Program your first machine learning software to understand the mechanism of machine learning.

### Competition

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Kaggle is a hosting service of data science competition. Data science is one of the practice of machine learning. Please read [the Kaggle guide page](./English/Kaggle/README.md).
