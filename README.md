## Learning Step

1. Take an online courses
2. Learn or Relearn required knowledge if you have difficulty
3. Build your environment to program some algorithm
4. Finish your course
5. Select the way you learn advance.

## Machine Learning

There are some well-known online courses learning Machine Learning.

* [Coursera: Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning): This is basic machine learning course. It may be the most popular learning resource. This is perfect except using Octave.
* [Udacity: Intro to machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)

### Requirements

The below is the list of Required knowledge. If you  If you want to learn about required knowledge, please read [requirements](./English/requirements.md).

* Math

### Environmental settings

I recommend you to use python and python-libraries, so I introduce you to install those in the [environment page](./English/environment.md).

## Advanced Guide

### Competition

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Kaggle is a hosting service of data science competition. data science is one of the most popular purpose of machine learning.
