### Online Courses

There are some well-known online courses learning Machine Learning.

* [Coursera: Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning): This is basic machine learning course. It may be the most popular learning resource. This is perfect except using Octave.
* [Udacity: Intro to machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
